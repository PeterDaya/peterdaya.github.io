I am a data scientist with a background in machine learning, building data pipelines, web and iOS development.  I have an MS in computer science from USC and a BA in biology from NYU.

During my MS, I took relevant coursework in machine learning, artificial intelligence, algorithms, full stack engineering, and database systems.
